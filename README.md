ü¶ü Project Overview
This project provides an AI-powered assistant that predicts dengue outbreak risk based on weather parameters. Featuring both voice interaction and a user-friendly web interface, it makes dengue risk assessment accessible to everyone.
‚ú® Key Features

Multilingual Voice Interaction: Speak to the system and get voice responses in your language
Weather-Based Prediction: Uses machine learning to analyze temperature, humidity, rainfall, and season
Dual Interfaces: Access via voice assistant or web form based on preference
Regional Language Support: Voice responses available in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, and English
Real-time Processing: Quick responses for both voice and manual inputs

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Speech Processing: Wav2Vec2 for Speech-to-Text conversion
Machine Learning: Random Forest model trained on historical dengue data
Text-to-Speech: Google TTS for natural voice responses
Web Framework: Flask for backend API and web server
UI Framework: Gradio for interactive machine learning interface
Data Visualization: Interactive risk visualization

üìã Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:
bashCopygit clone https://github.com/Pranay02jul/AI_Healthcare_Project?tab=readme-ov-file
cd dengue-ai-assistant

Install dependencies:
bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:
bashCopypython app.py

Access the web interface:

Flask interface: http://localhost:5000
Gradio interface: http://localhost:7860



üé§ Using the Voice Assistant

Click the microphone button in the web interface
Speak your weather parameters clearly:
Copy"Temperature is 32 degrees, humidity is 85 percent, rainfall is 120 mm, and month is 6"

The system will process your speech, extract parameters, and respond with a risk assessment
Choose your preferred response language from the dropdown menu

üñ±Ô∏è Using the Manual Interface

Enter the weather parameters in the form:

Temperature (¬∞C)
Humidity (%)
Rainfall (mm)
Month (1-12)


Click "Predict" to get your risk assessment

üîç How It Works

Voice Processing Pipeline:

Speech capture using browser's microphone API
Speech-to-Text conversion using Wav2Vec2
Parameter extraction using natural language processing
Risk prediction using the trained model
Text-to-Speech conversion for response


Prediction Model:

Random Forest classifier trained on historical dengue data
Features: temperature, humidity, rainfall, and month
Output: "High Risk" or "Low Risk" classification



üìä Dataset
The model was trained using historical dengue outbreak data from India spanning 1991-2022, combined with corresponding weather parameters. The dataset shows clear correlations between specific weather conditions and dengue outbreaks.
üîÆ Future Enhancements

Geolocation Integration: Automatically fetch local weather data
Mobile App: Standalone application for Android and iOS
Offline Support: Function without internet connection
Expanded Language Support: Additional regional languages
Prediction Visualization: Graphical representation of risk factors
